# Brute Force Attack Detection and Response with Wazuh

This repository showcases a multi-platform SOC simulation lab built using **Wazuh**, where brute-force attacks on both **Linux (SSH)** and **Windows (RDP)** are detected, visualized, and automatically blocked using **Active Response**.

---

## üîê Project Highlights

### üîπ SSH Brute Force Detection & Response (Linux)
- Detected SSH brute-force attempts by monitoring `/var/log/auth.log` on Ubuntu client.
- Simulated attacks using **Hydra** and visualized them in the **Wazuh Dashboard**.
- Configured **Wazuh Active Response** (Rule ID: 5710) to block attacker IPs for 10 minutes.

### üîπ RDP Brute Force Detection & Response (Windows)
- Enabled Remote Desktop on a **Windows 11 Enterprise** client with Wazuh agent.
- Simulated **Hydra**-based RDP brute-force attacks from Kali Linux.
- Detected using Rule IDs `60122`, `60204` and blocked using **Active Response**.
