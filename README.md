# Brute Force Attack Detection and Response using Wazuh

This repository showcases a two-part project focused on detecting and responding to brute-force SSH login attempts using **Wazuh**.  
It demonstrates both **log analysis** for identifying attacks and **active response** for automatically blocking malicious IPs.

## üìö Project Parts

### 1. Brute Force Log Analysis using Wazuh
- Configured Wazuh agent to monitor `/var/log/auth.log` for failed SSH login attempts.
- Set up an SSH server on the client machine.
- Simulated brute-force attacks using **Hydra** from a Kali Linux attacker machine.
- Detected suspicious activity using Wazuh and visualized alerts in the Threat Hunting dashboard.

### 2. Response to Brute Force Attack with Wazuh Active Response
- Configured **Wazuh Active Response** to trigger a **firewall-drop** when a brute-force attack is detected (Rule ID: 5710).
- Automatically blocked attacker IPs for **10 minutes** after multiple failed SSH login attempts.
- Simulated the attack again and successfully verified that active response blocked further SSH login attempts.
- Alerts and response events were visualized in the Wazuh Dashboard.
